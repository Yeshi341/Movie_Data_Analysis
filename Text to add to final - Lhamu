## Overview

(The OTT (Over-the-top) video streaming market has grown significantly in the last decade. Major OTT video streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, have had much success in not just creating a platform for video streaming, but also creating their own original video content. The market size of the Movie and Video production industry is over $30 billion and Microsoft  wants to enter this market by creating its own movie studio. So, this project is conducted to do some research on the movie industry, to find out what kind of movies have been successful based on the data collected.)
Microsoft is a technology and tech services company. The movie and production industry is unchartered grounds for Microsoft. To enter and compete in this market, it must first understand what kinds of production work and what does not. Here in, lies Microsoft's problem

Questions:
3. What genre of movies are people most excited about voting on ?
4. Are movie ratings affected by movie runtimes ?

Reasons:
3. Most probably than not, a person will only vote on a movie if they have seen it in the first place. For someone to be drawn to watch a movie and then actually go online to the imdb site and vote on it tells us that the movie brought some level of excitement. I wanted to find in what genre do the movies most voted on fall in. For Microsoft this inquiry tells them what genre movies are most popular among movie goers.
4. In knowing whether the time length of a movie affects how high a movie is rated, gives us an idea of whether people are put off by long movies or not. Based on the data, we can also provide some inference on the ideal time length of a movie. 

## Data Understanding

In order to answer the data analysis questions, only certain datasets were picked to identify and isolate the target variables that are needed to answer the queries and understand the underlying behavior of the variable.

To answer the aforementioned question 3, the IMDB title basics, the IMDB title ratings, and the TMDB movies datasets were combined to form a single dataset 'movie_ratings_info'. This dataset includes the movies and their properties that describe it like, movie runtime, movie average rating, the number of voters who voted on the ratings, movie release dates, and the genre the movie belonged to. 
The sample of movies here are movies that can be found on the IMDB and the TMDB websites and for whom movie rating information was available. The target variable here is the average rating a movie received. The average_rating variable is a weighted average value of the movie ratings information from the two websites. A rating value is between the range of 1 to 10 where 10 is the highest rating indicating a well approved movie. 
The ratings value from the IMDB site, is calculated by taking a weighted average for ratings provided by all IMDB user, according to the IMDB site (https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/ratings-faq/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV#calculate). The rating ranges from 1 to 10. When users go online on the TMDB site, they get to vote on the movies by how many stars they want to give on a range of 1 to 5. Each star carries two points which bring the vote up to a scale of 1 to 10.  
Although the ratings for a movie are given by people who are members of IMDB and TMDB, .......... 



## Data Preparation

In preparing the dataset, variables that were duplicates (like the multiple title variables, the duplicate genre variable) were dropped from the final data. There are two variables created to help answer the question; 'average_rating' and 'number_votes'. 
Some effort was made to salvage any missing rating and voter count information, by replacing the missing values in one column with its corresponding other rating or voter count column.
The 'average_rating' variable was then created as a weighted average of the movie ratings information from the two websites. Similarly, the 'number_votes' variable was also created as a weighted average of the voter count information from the two websites. Any observation with missing values that affected the target variable 'average_rating' and 'number_votes' was also dropped.

Missing movie rating information had to be dropped because keeping it may create noise in the dataset by indicating something that may not be true. Just because a movie has no rating, does not mean the movie was rated 0 or 1. Replacing missing values with the mean or median here, also adds misinformation to the dataset. Hence, observations with missing value for movie rating information was dropped.
The popularity value as calculated on tmdb is based on the volume of interactions, like number of vote, number of users that marked the movie as favorite, number of views etc. This variable does not have any range and the website draws meaning from it mainly through its popularity ranking score per day. 

## Methods

Beginning to any data analysis and after retrieving data, comes the crucial part of data cleaning. There were a lot of 'Nan' values in the dataset. Some of the variables were of string datatype that needed to be changed to a numeric datatype, to be able to perform analysis

## Data Modeling

To answer the question of genre of movies voted on, I wanted to understand my target variable and how it related to other variables in the dataset.  To do this, I first calculated the descriptive statistics on the data to analyze all relevant variables. 
The average average-rating for a movie in our sample of movies is 6.33. Most of the movies are rated between 4.85 and 7.80, based on one standard deviation of 1.47 on either side of the average average-rating. The 50th percentile or the median average-rating is 6.5 and the average-rating value for movies occurring the most number of times, or the mode is 6.6. Notice, how the mean, median and the mode of the sample is very similar, from which we can guess that the distribution of average-rating for movies in the imdb and tmdb sites follow a close to normal distribution. This allows for a good confidence in target variable in our sample to represent movie ratings in the industry.
Similarly, based on our sample the average movie runtime is about 95 minutes.
I also wanted to understand whether average rating for a movie changed with as the number of voters on a movie was higher or lower. On running a correlation test and plotting the two variables using a scatterplot, I found that average rating for a movie was not much affected by how many people voted on the movie. From the figure you can see how most of the observations cluster low and flat and then lean very slightly to the right as it slopes upwards, the average rating increasing as the number of voters for a movie increases. You could almost say that there is no correlation between the two variables. The correlation value between the two variables is a positive 0.039. No matter how many people vote on a movie, the average rating for that movie rarely changes.
Movies tend to have overlapping genres or fall in the category of more than one genre. Genres describe a movie based on the story, plot, character and setting of a movie (https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/exploring-movie-construction-and-production/chapter/2-what-is-genre-and-how-is-it-determined/). Movie viewers also use this information to decide on whether they are interested in watching the movie or not. To see what kinds of movie people are watching for movies in the sample, I used a horizontal bar plot to visualize the genres that appeared most in the sample. Most movies in the sample fall in the drama genre and a good proportion of them fall in the thriller, horrow, comedy, and documentary genre. 
I also wanted to see if average rating of a movie is affected by the runtime of a movie. I used a subset of the sample dataset for all the movies in the sample with average ratings greater than 8. The scatterplot on the two variables show that there is no correlation between the two variables. It can be infered from here that how long or short a movie is, is not considered when a movie viewer gives a movie rating.

## Evaluation

I have good confidence in my target variable as a representative of the average ratings for all movies in the industry. The light shone on the average rating for a movie can be dark or bright. To some movie viewers average rating for a movie is enough to decide on it, while others need to know more about the movie and place little significance on just the movie average rating. Regardless it is an indicator of how good or bad a movie is. Based on the results, I can offer Microsoft information on what genres of movies have been popular, the expected average rating for a good movie, and the average runtime of a successful movie (on IMBD and TMDB).

## Conclusion

Based on the model, I would recommend that Microsoft make movies within the genres of drama, thriller, horrow, comedy, and documentary. An ideal length for a successful movie can range from about 60 mins to 168 mins. 
The analysis provided here does not fully solve all the pain points for Microsoft entering a new market; movie industry. The sample data is too small as well as constrained to only those movies available on the IMDB and TMDB web sources. The sample data from these sources also had a lot of missing information as well as mixed information (TVshows and movies), with little clarity on which is what. This does put little confidence on how well it represent the population.
To improve on this project more data exploration, that reflect on the success of a movie is needed. One could also run an analysis on the story plots of the successful movies to find out what works best.
